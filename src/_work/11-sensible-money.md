A financial planning company, Sensible Money knew it was time to upgrade their site with a mobile-first approach that would give their savvy customers easy access to vital information across multiple platforms—be it a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop. Rather than working from Photoshop mockups, the design developed organically from a Word doc outline using block diagrams to establish the relative size of fonts and sections onscreen through rapid iterations. Styling content was added directly in the browser for a spectrum mobile-approach that presented all the essential information on a phone while allowing for more styling as the screen and bandwidth grew. The integrated custom wordpress blog keeps the site current and fresh while the theme stays true to the company’s brand.
