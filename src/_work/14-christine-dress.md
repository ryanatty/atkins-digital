- Capturing the moment of trying on wedding dresses
- Anthropology was the idea behind the look and feel
- Focusing on expressions in the mirror
- Facial expressions, hands
- Shallow depth of field to help focus the viewer's attention
- Wide shots to get to establish setting
- All done with a 50mm lense for a classic feel
- more desaturated colors (yellows, blues, grain)
