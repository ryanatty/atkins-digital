As a world leader in the aviation aftermarket, AvAir relies on their website to show the millions of inventoried aircraft parts they offer to their 1600 customers in 60 countries around the globe. As time, accuracy, and price are essential to their success, this site demanded a mobile-first approach with a custom developed file sharing web app for quickly locating the right inventoried part. Developed from photoshop mockups, the responsive grid scales cleanly as the screen size increases. The innovative use of parallax effects create an engaging user experience while a custom developed resume upload feature makes it easy for new candidates to come aboard.
