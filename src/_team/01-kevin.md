A lover of film, editing, motion design and drama, I grew up watching Band of Brothers, skateboarding to Blink-182, and spending many a night listening to Miles Davis while learning whatever I could about the events that shaped the 20th century.

I always knew I wanted a life that revolved around history, art and storytelling. I came into videography and editing through a circuitous route by writing songs and performing in a band. During that time I discovered I preferred to be on the other side of the cameraâ€”shooting and editing our music videos rather than performing in them.

As a freelance videographer and editor since 2011, I have enjoyed being a part of a team, taking direction from other stakeholders, yet I deliver just as well when working independently. Clients say I am a natural storyteller. They appreciate my ability to show how we can achieve the goal of their project, while making their story come to life with an intimacy and emotion that people will remember through skillful camera work and editing.
